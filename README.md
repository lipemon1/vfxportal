# VFX Portal

Yeah! My first shader on Unity

</p>

I had made it with the help of [Jettelly](https://www.jettelly.com/en/) patreon content

### Changes

As my first shader, beyond the original content I added a Color property to the PortalSpace material, so I can change the space texture color.

Feel free to use commercial or not (:
